~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gather data on the part of uniterm / fontset used, either in u2ps or in psfrem,
and cut unused parts at psfrem stage.


Bidi support
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting with some idea on how it should work in context of terminal emulation.
Also, will likely require procset reduction due to being large but largely-unused
feature.


Opentype fonts support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FreeMono is available in otf format, and otf fonts may smaller
(but this doesn't apply to FreeMono apparently).
