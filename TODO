* Bi-directional text.
  See doc/bidi.txt and http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/

* Proper combining mark positioning.
  This surprisingly requires a lot of work, likely including
  a complete rewrite (and re-design) of the psfrem part.
  Reserved for version 2.x.
  See doc/gpos.txt

* OpenType fonts support.
  This is a big question mark since neither GS nor the actual
  PostScript printers are guaranteed to support OT glyphs.

* u2pdf
  Generating PDF output directly. This will probably be a different
  project altogether, *but* a lot of stuff from u2ps should be
  reusable there.
