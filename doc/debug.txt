Debugging and making changes to u2ps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run u2ps, psfrem and ttf2pt42 right from the source directory.

When editing or debugging resources, it may be handy to avoid embedding them.
Assuming you're in the source directory:

	./u2ps -E test.txt
	gs -Ips test.ps

Or if you want gv:

	./u2ps -E test.txt
	gv -arguments=-Ips test.ps

This way you will be editing master copies and any changes made
will be effective immediately.
The only exception is ps/setup.ps, that is the part that is embedded
in the output document.

For any postscript-related debugging, check ps/ProcSet/printf.
