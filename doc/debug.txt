Debugging and making changes to u2ps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run u2ps, psfrem and ttf2pt42 right from the source directory.

When editing or debugging resources, it may be handy to avoid embedding them.
Assuming you're in the source directory:

	./u2ps -E test.txt
	gs -Ires test.ps

Or if you want gv:

	./u2ps -E test.txt
	gv -arguments=-Ires test.ps

This way you will be editing master copies and any changes made
will be effective immediately.

For any postscript-related debugging, check res/ProcSet/printf.
