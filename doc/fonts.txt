Installing u2ps-specific fonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In some cases it may be useful to make u2ps use some fonts
without affecting gs configuration.
In particular, you may want to have dedicated (older) FreeMono,
or maybe some fonts for unusual unicode ranges.

Because of the way gs works, this is relatively easy to do:

1. place font files into /usr/share/u2ps/ps/fonts directory.
2. add font to /usr/share/u2ps/ps/Fontmap file

Fontmap syntax is described in that file. For most fonts,
it should be something like this:

	/FontName	(fonts/fontfile.ttf) ;

You may wish to put font file is some other location,
or perhaps use a font from a different location.
Skip #1 and add full path to Fontmap, it should work right away.


Editing fontsets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For u2ps to actually use a new font, you will have to edit fontsets
as well. Check /usr/share/u2ps/ps/FontSet/* files for syntax and structure.
Generally you need to add a key to the first dictionary:

	<<
		/base  		{ /FreeMono .... }
		...
		/newfont 	{ /NewFont findfont }
	>>

and list character ranges the font should be checked for:

	[
		[ 16#0000 16#303F /base ]
		...
		[ 16#F000 16#F100 /newfont ]
	] makefontset

Ranges are checked top-to-bottom, so make sure you have no unplanned range overlaps.
