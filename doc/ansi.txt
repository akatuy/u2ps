u2ps supports limited subset of VT100 control codes.
See console_codes(4) for some introduction.

Generally the support is limited to font style/color and basic line/page control.
Cursor movement and similar things are not supported.


CSI m sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terminal state is tracked in the c part only, with ps output getting simple direct
commands (set-font, set-color and so on). This allows keeping support for rarely-used
attributes without bloating the output.

CSI 1;31m sets both bold font and bright red color; this is consistent with rxvt behavior.
To set bright colors with regular font, use CSI 9Nm and CSI 10Nm sequences.

Colors 0 and 16 both have #000000 value. Same for rxvt.

CSI 5m, 6m (blinking and rapidly blinking) are shown as bold. Again, consistent with rxvt.
Unlike rxvt however, u2ps has a dedicated bit for 6m. Because why not.

CSI 2m (faint/half-bright), 7m (reverse) and 8m (invisible) change current neutral color,
and only have effect when no color has been set explicitly via 31-38m or similar commands.
Thus, "invisible-red" text will look red and quite visible.
No idea whether this is correct, most terminals do not support these attributes anyway.

CSI 2Nm undoes respective CSI Nm (i.e. 5=blink / 25=no-blink, 7=reverse / 27=no-reverse).
