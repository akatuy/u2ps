Version issues: 0.8 vs 0.9.


Where are my fonts?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting with version 0.9, u2ps uses system fonts.
That is, fonts gs can find in its path.

There is no need to supply any general-use fonts with u2ps anymore,
especially given FreeMono is quite common and is very likely to
be present somewhere in the system.

One exception here are TT fonts lacking "post" table (e.g. Kochi-Mincho).
These should be converted to .pfa, placed in u2ps/ps/fonts and listed
in u2ps/ps/Fontmap.

Also, unlike v0.8, there is nothing specific about u2ps/ps/fonts anymore,
it's just that gs will be called with -Iu2ps/ps option to allow it to find
fonts there.

Since most common TT fonts have post table and fonts without post table
tend to cover unusual ranges, the whole thing was removed from u2ps bundle.
In case you need those ranges, procure the fonts yourself and convert them
using supplied ttf2pt42.px.

Supplying fonts with u2ps like it was done in 0.8 simplified full-font
embedding, because supplied fonts were guaranteed to be "clean" pfa text
files. In 0.9, full-font embedding is done the same way as reduced-font
embedding, by dumping loaded font from within gs, and notdef.pfa
is handled as a special case.


Where are my fontsets?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All available fontsets are now bundled with u2ps (in ps/FontSet directory).
No additional packages are needed.


Font-embedding utilites from v0.8x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
u2ps_pp.px and u2ps_rs.px have been replaced with simplier one-pass psfrem.px.
This makes it just a bit harder to debug but significantly faster and easier
to use, including on non-u2ps files.


Regarding output file size: v0.8 vs v0.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It may look like v0.9 generates significantly larger output files that v0.8
with FreeMono fontset and font embedding enabled.

This is actually mostly because of the changes in FreeMono font itself.
v0.8 had an old version bundled with it, and "old" here means something like 2007.
v0.9 loads system font, which for most systems means current version.


u2ps options
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Options have been adjusted a bit to match a2ps wherever it made sense.


Whole-font embedding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlike v0.8 where it was a safe fallback skipping the whole font-handling part,
embedding whole fonts now requires about as much work as reducing them.
And that part is not implemented yet.

The reason to keep this option at all is embedding u2ps output in some other
PS document which uses the same fonts. Pretty rare case by itself, and with
current version there's at least one workaround: embed no-fonts output, then
run psfrem on the whole resulting document.
