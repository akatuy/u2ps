About
~~~~~
u2ps is text to postscript converter similar to a2ps,
with emphasis on Unicode support.

Key features:
* wide-range unicode support via font sets (see rxvt-unicode);
  u2ps does not depend on a single font to provide the whole range
* unicode support implemented in PostScript
* clean, readable and reasonably small output files
* font subset embedding for Type 1 and Type 42 (TTF) fonts
* ANSI control sequences support (color and font variants)


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run u2ps, perl >= 5.6 and ghostscript are needed.

	./configure --prefix=...
	make
	make install


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See man page and text files in doc/ directory.


Github note
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is git-controlled and somewhat modernized version
of my old project from Berlios.
It has been neglected for years and I'm now trying to revive it.
Some features may be missing, some present but not documented.
