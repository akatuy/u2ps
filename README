About
~~~~~
u2ps is text to postscript converter similar to a2ps,
with emphasis on Unicode support.

Key features:

* unicode support implemented in PostScript
* clean, readable and reasonably small output files
* font subset embedding for Type 1 and Type 42 (TTF) fonts
* ANSI control sequences support (color and font variants)

Things missing at present (and possibly ever):

- proper combining mark positioning
- reordering and ligatures
- bidi support

As long as the input does not stray too far from common ltr scripts
and usable font(s) are available, u2ps should work well.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Common C library, make and cc are needed to build u2ps.
If you want font and resource reduction (you do), ghostscript must
be available at runtime.

	./configure --prefix=...
	make
	make install

Unless told otherwise, u2ps defaults to FreeMono font.
Make sure you have it installed.

For hacking/debugging, run "./configure devel" instead, the resulting
executable will work right from the source directory.


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See man page and text files in doc/ directory.


Github note
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a modernized version of my old project from Berlios,
now rewritten in C, with a lot of incompatible changes.

Check perl branch for the original code if you need it.
