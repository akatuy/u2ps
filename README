About
~~~~~
u2ps is text to postscript converter similar to a2ps,
with emphasis on Unicode support.

Key features:

* utf8 support implemented (mostly) in PostScript
* clean, readable and reasonably small output files
* font subset embedding for Type 1 and Type 42 (TTF) fonts
* ANSI control sequences support (color and font variants)

Things missing at present:

- proper combining mark positioning
- reordering and ligatures
- bidi support

The tool should be usable on any reasonably sane system with
Ghostscript installed.

As long as the input does not stray too far from common ltr scripts
and usable font(s) are available, u2ps should work well.

Current version is probably the last one using mostly-postscript
mostly-font-agnostic approach; check TODO for further development
ideas.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Common C library, make and cc are needed to build u2ps.
If you want font and resource reduction (you do), ghostscript must
be available at runtime.

	./configure --prefix=...
	make
	make install

Unless told otherwise, u2ps defaults to FreeMono font.
Make sure you have it installed.

For hacking/debugging, run "./configure devel" instead, the resulting
executable will work right from the source directory.


Sample usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The files in text/ directory may be used as a showcase for u2ps features.
Assuming you built u2ps in devel mode, run

    ./u2ps text/ansi.txt
    ./u2ps text/alph.txt
    ./u2ps text/utf8.txt
    ./u2ps -2 -f FreeMono -f Kochi -f Tlwg text/alph.txt
    ./u2ps -2 -f FreeMono -f Kochi -f Tlwg text/utf8.txt

The last command assumes you have Kochi-Mincho (http://en.osdn.jp/projects/efont/)
and Tlwg (http://linux.thai.net/projects/fonts-tlwg) fonts installed.

Sample usage with individual font setting:

    ./u2ps -2 -f FreeMono -fC:SawarabiGothic-Medium text/alph.txt

This works for fonts not known to u2ps.

See man page and text files in doc/ directory.


Github note
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a modernized version of my old project from Berlios,
now rewritten in C, with a lot of incompatible changes.

Check perl branch for the original code if you need it.
