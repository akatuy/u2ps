Sample input files for u2ps.

Make sure to run u2ps from top-level source directory,
it won't find its files otherwise.
Something like this:

	./u2ps.px text/ansi.txt


Output for alph.txt and utf8.txt depends on available fonts.
Without additional efforts, CJK and Thai characters are likely
to be missing.
